        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from 
            the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a 
            couple of changes suggested to me by people from 
            the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if 
            there should be milk added or not. One thing never 
            in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets.
            These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, 
            simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using 
            fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.</p>
